# SESTQA-Assignment2
This is the second assignment in my Software Engineering Software Testing and Quality Insurance class.

I downloaded Python 3.8 from the Microsoft store for the purposes of this assignment. The operating system used
was Windows 10. The version of python listed in the command line was 3.8.8. To run the main program, navigate 
to the directory of the files within the command line and run “python main.py”. This will run the main program. 
To run all tests at the same time, the command “python -m unittest -v” can be used. To run the unit tests individually 
“python -m unittest [test_file_name.py] -v” can be used.
